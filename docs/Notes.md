# ChatGPT prompts to learn about the structure of siliwiz program

**Question** *I am a beginner programmer and i want to tweak the following software https://github.com/TinyTapeout/siliwiz Can you tell me the structure of this program so i can hack around this code*

**Answer**
The SiliWiz repository on GitHub is structured as follows:

.github/: GitHub-specific configurations.
.husky/: Git hooks for managing code quality.
.vscode/: Visual Studio Code configurations.
functions/: Contains cloud functions for the backend.
patches/: Patches for third-party code.
presets/: Configuration presets.
public/: Static assets for the frontend.
src/: Main source code, including components and utilities.
For local development, you'll need Node.js and NPM. Clone the repository, run npm install to install dependencies, and use npm run dev to start the development server.

**Question** *Can you summarize the software structure on https://github.com/TinyTapeout/siliwiz/src*

**Answer** The src directory in the SiliWiz repository is the main hub for the application's source code. Here's a breakdown of its key components:

1. *components/*: This folder contains reusable UI components, often React components, that make up the user interface of the application. These components can range from simple buttons to complex forms.

2. *pages/*: This folder typically includes the different pages of the web application. Each file or folder within pages represents a different route in the application, corresponding to different URLs that users can visit.

3. *styles/*: Contains global styles and CSS modules specific to various components. These styles define the visual appearance of the application.

4. *utils/*: Utility functions that are used throughout the application. These can include helper functions, data processing functions, or other common logic that needs to be reused across different parts of the codebase.

5. *services/*: Often includes code related to data fetching and API interactions. This could be where the application communicates with a backend server or external APIs.

6. *hooks/*: Custom React hooks that encapsulate reusable logic. Hooks can manage state, handle side effects, or interact with context providers.

7. *context/*: Contains React context providers and consumers that manage global state across the application.

For tweaking the software, you can start by exploring the components and pages directories to understand how the UI is structured and how navigation works. Modifying styles in the styles folder can help you change the look and feel of the application, while the services and utils folders are crucial for understanding and modifying data handling and business logic.
